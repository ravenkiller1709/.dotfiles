** EXWM Configuration

We use the excellent [[https://github.com/ch11ng/exwm][EXWM]] module as the basis for our Emacs Desktop Environment.  The [[https://github.com/ch11ng/exwm/wiki][EXWM Wiki]] is a great place to find tips about how to configure everything!

*NOTE:* Make sure you've installed =nm-applet=, =pasystray= and =blueman= for the system tray apps to work!

* Desktop Environment

** Desktop Key Bindings

We use the [[https://github.com/DamienCassou/desktop-environment][desktop-environment]] package to automatically bind to well-known programs for controlling the volume, screen brightness, media playback, and doing other things like locking the screen and taking screenshots.  Make sure that you install the necessary programs to make this functionality work!  Check the [[https://github.com/DamienCassou/desktop-environment#default-configuration][default programs]] list to know what you need to install.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle ./desktop.el

  (use-package desktop-environment
    :after exwm
    :config (desktop-environment-mode)
    :custom
    (desktop-environment-brightness-small-increment "2%+")
    (desktop-environment-brightness-small-decrement "2%-")
    (desktop-environment-brightness-normal-increment "5%+")
    (desktop-environment-brightness-normal-decrement "5%-"))

#+end_src

** Desktop File

This file is used by your "login manager" (GDM, LightDM, etc) to display EXWM as a desktop environment option when you log in.

*IMPORTANT*: Make sure you create a symbolic link for this file into =/usr/share/xsessions=:

#+begin_src sh :tangle no

sudo ln -f ~/.config/emacs/exwm/EXWM.desktop /usr/share/xsessions/EXWM.desktop

#+end_src

#+begin_src shell :tangle ./exwm/EXWM.desktop :mkdirp yes

  [Desktop Entry]
  Name=EXWM
  Comment=Emacs Window Manager
  Exec=sh /home/kim/.config/emacs/exwm/start-exwm.sh
  TryExec=sh
  Type=Application
  X-LightDM-DesktopName=exwm
  DesktopNames=exwm

#+end_src

** Launcher Script

This launcher script is invoked by =EXWM.desktop= to start Emacs and load our desktop environment configuration.  We also start up some other helpful applications to configure the desktop experience.

#+begin_src shell :tangle ./exwm/start-exwm.sh :shebang #!/bin/sh

  # Set the screen DPI (uncomment this if needed!)
  # xrdb ~/.emacs.d/exwm/Xresources
  setxkbmap dk &
  # Run the screen compositor
  compton &

  # Enable screen locking on suspend
  xss-lock -- slock &

  # Fire it up
  exec dbus-launch --exit-with-session emacs -mm --debug-init -l ~/.config/emacs/desktop.el

#+end_src

** Keyboard Configuration

The =Xmodmap= file will be used with the =xmodmap= program to remap CapsLock to Ctrl inside of our desktop environment:

#+begin_src sh :tangle ./exwm/Xmodmap

  clear lock
  clear control
  keycode 66 = Control_L
  add control = Control_L
  add Lock = Control_R

#+end_src

** DPI configuration

The =Xresources= file will be used with =xrdb= in =start-exwm.sh= to set our screen DPI:

#+begin_src conf :tangle ./exwm/Xresources

  Xft.dpi:   100   # Set this to your desired DPI!  Larger number means bigger text and UI

#+end_src

** Panel with Polybar

Polybar provides a great, minimalistic panel for your EXWM desktop configuration.  The following config integrates =emacsclient= and Polybar with =polybar-msg= to enable you to gather *any* information from Emacs and display it in the panel!

Check out the Polybar wiki for more details on how to configure it: https://github.com/polybar/polybar/wiki

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle ./desktop.el

        ;; Make sure the server is started (better to do this in your main Emacs config!)
        (server-start)

        (defvar efs/polybar-process nil
          "Holds the process of the running Polybar instance, if any")

        (defun efs/kill-panel ()
          (interactive)
          (when efs/polybar-process
            (ignore-errors
              (kill-process efs/polybar-process)))
          (setq efs/polybar-process nil))

        (defun efs/start-panel ()
          (interactive)
          (efs/kill-panel)
          (setq efs/polybar-process (start-process-shell-command "polybar" nil "polybar panel")))
